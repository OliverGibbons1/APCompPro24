# Individual Project 
This will be the final for the AP Computer Programming course. It will entail 30+ hours of work and will include advanced programming concepts. 

The project is a tower defense game; the concepts being implemented include abstract classes, class hierarchy, multidimensional arrays, enhanced for-loops, GUI, ternary statements, and lots of collections. There will be comments scattered throughout the code (and extensive encapsulation) to help readability.
